# Inferring the timing and strength of natural selection and gene migration in the evolution of chicken from ancient DNA data
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring the timing and strength of natural selection and gene migration from time series data of allele frequencies, the article has been published in Molecular Ecology Resources available at https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13553.

v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the joint inference of the timing and strength of natural selection and gene migration.

v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the joint inference of the timing and strength of natural selection and gene migration, including the estimation of the allele frequency trajectories of the underlying population.

REAL includes the source code tailed to the analysis of TSHR and BCDO2, including the aDNA dataset for European chicken.
